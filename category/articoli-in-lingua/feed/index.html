										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Irish folklore describes Leprechauns as men who wore red or green outfits and tri-cornered hats. These mischievous creatures can be tracked back to the 8<sup>th</sup>-century tales about water spirits which were known as <strong>‘luchorpán’</strong> which means ‘<em>small body</em>’. Even though some researchers think that the term Leprechaun actually comes from the Irish term ‘leath brogan’ which means shoemaker.<br>According to mythology, these little men find gold coins buried in the ground and store them all in a pot which is hidden at the end of a rainbow. But since they can’t actually spend it, some believe that this gold is used as a means of tricking humans and given the Leprechauns’ propensity for trickery, this is possible.<br>Leprechauns are extremely difficult to catch or trap, but if you happen to capture one of them, you can trade his freedom for his treasure and he will grant you three wishes provided you let him go.</p>



<p>According to a History of Irish Fairies by Carolyn White, there are no female leprechauns: there is no evidence of how they reproduce. The book says that leprechauns are actually deformed children of fairies. Although the legend is over a thousand years old, a Leprechaun was spotted in 1989 by a pub owner in Carlingford, County Louth. The man, O&#8217;Hare, claims to have heard screaming from a well and found the remains and clothing of a leprechaun. Each year the city organizes a Leprechaun hunt, although the aim of the game is to find plastic versions of the legendary creature.</p>



<p>Behind this myth there is a moral of the story. The fact that Leprechauns often deceive people who seek the &#8220;golden plate&#8221; can be a warning for people not to get rich quickly and not to interfere with other people&#8217;s things. However, the stories of the Leprechaun should not be taken seriously but told to amuse and delight us.</p>



<p>So, if you hear a tapping hammer and a wee voice singing, keep a sharp eye out, for there may be a leprechaun nearby!<br><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>How do you think we will live in the future? Who knows&#8230; Maybe teleportation will exist and distance will no longer be a problem; We will have no complaints about late delivery because there will be drones; in supermarkets everything will be automatic, there will be robots that help us in daily work; there will be no more highways because we will use flying cars orwe could evengo to Mars whenever we want as if it were a normal thing.</p>



<p>In any case, the future starts today and for once it looks bright; the birth of smart cities is only one example. Smart cities havean extremely specific purpose: to improve the quality of life of the people who live there, ensuring environmental, economic, and social sustainability.</p>



<p>The founding element is technology, in all its expressions, from the use of innovative tools to data analysis software environment too, butenvironmental sustainability is not only the efficiency of the transport system, but concerns every aspect of urban life: architectural solutions and buildings designed in an environmentally friendly way, extensive use of renewable energy sources and devices equipped with artificial intelligence. Technology, is essential for the careful management of resources and search for high-tech.</p>



<p>One of the most sustainable and innovative ideas is the invention of the so-called &#8220;HUNTING POLLUTION&#8221; these are massive works of art painted on the walls of buildings with anti-smog paint formulated by the Italian artist Federico Massa. He is the artist who used AIRLITE technology, an ecological paint that cleans the air. An example of this artistic work can be found in Italy:  the first eco-mural in the world was created in Rome and it is the greatest of Europe! It is a new green lung for the for the capital: 1000 square meters of amazing art able to clean the air like a forest of 30 trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="" alt="" /></figure>



<p>You might certainly feel you have woken up in the next century&nbsp; in one &nbsp;of the most famous smart cities in the world,&nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore:&nbsp; a Southeast Asian&nbsp; island and city state at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, with a population of 5.686 million people.Since 2019, the city has been considered the world’s smartest city because&nbsp; it works to “enhance the benefits and diminish the shortcomings of urbanization for its citizens.”</p>



<p>With 80% of its residents living in public housing, the country offers an extremely sleek system of public transportation called the Mass Rapid Transit. This is an underground system of transportation that reaches all over Singapore, and the concealed system of transportation creates an emphasis on public spaces. The urban organization of Singapore intends its residents to enjoy an ample number of public spaces, and urban forestry making the city very sustainable and green.</p>



<p>If you ever happen to take a trip to Singapore in addition to the fascinating historical monuments and natural parks do not miss the interactive museums that give you the feeling of being in a science fiction movie offering a lot of multimedia content. Another attraction is the &#8220;Supertree Grove&#8221;. The amazing thing is that these giants 25 to 50 meters high are incredibly non-polluting works of art! Indeed, their foliage is characterized by photovoltaic panels, and ventilation ducts capable of creating energy for lighting and giving extraordinary games of light and music during the night.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="301" height="226" src="https://opstime.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Immagine.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3350" /></figure>



<p>I must say that I am optimistic. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.In my opinion if  we all have the same goal, we can do everything to make our planet a better place for future generations too; investing capital adequately and using human intelligence not for destructive purposes, but for solutions that do not put at risk the only HOME we have. Well, with smart cities the future is already here!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now, I dare you all to think how you would feel if you walked into a place where you do not know anyone and those few people you know behave like strangers to you. Of course, you would feel uncomfortable with all eyes on you. I think anyone would like to be welcomed when they are in a group. For example, when you first enter a new class, you feel oppressed by the looks of others and feel bad. I really think that nowadays at the base of this big problem there are always prejudices. </p>



<p>Today  people often give more importance to the way of dressing and physical appearance, neglecting the character of a person. If you do not dress fashionably or if simply your thinking is different from others you are seen as a strange person, especially among teenagers, diversity and  originality are seen as something ugly or even scary. </p>



<p>In my opinion this also depends on the influence of social media, on the different trends or fashions that <s>&nbsp;</s>&nbsp;they impose on society, encouraging young people to behave in&nbsp; a similar way.&nbsp; If the mass behaves all in the same way,&nbsp; the small percentage of people who do not want or cannot afford it, feel isolated and always under pressure.</p>



<p>It is time for fresh thinking, we should all be kind and sympathetic, we shouldn’t  be afraid of changes     but be ready for enrichment, because diversity is wealth and it is a gift! So, you must try to put yourself in other people&#8217;s shoes and make an effort to see what they really are. For example, if a person does not have the same style of dressing or way of speaking, why don’t start talking and find out how similar you are!   You might discover that you maybe have the same musical tastes, you both like  the same type of films, or you might be amazed to find out that the person you have in front of you   has lots of talents; that after all this shy and introvert person is funny and nice.</p>



<p>Sometimes it takes little to make someone day, with a smile, a hello or just asking how you are! I think you’ll agree with me that there is an urgent  need for inclusivity, that friendliness and kindness can bring down barriers among people; that everyone must do their small part to build a relationship, friendship or interaction. </p>



<p>“<em>Diversity and inclusion are about giving value to every human being, no matter our differences to make the world a better place</em>”</p>

<p>Who is Krampus, you may ask. &nbsp;<br>Krampus, in central European popular legend, a half-goat, half-demon monster that, in the night of December 5, comes to visit children who didn’t behaved and beats them with a bundle of birch sticks, in order to drag them to his lair to be tortured or eaten. Its roots have nothing to do with Christmas. Instead, they date back to pre-Germanic paganism in the region. His name originates with the German <em>krampen</em>, which means &#8220;claw,&#8221; and tradition wants that he is the son of the Norse god of the underworld, Hel.&nbsp;<br>He is the devilish counterpart of St. Nicholas, who is the patron saint of children and on the 6<sup>th</sup> December puts candy in the shoes of good kids and birch twigs in the shoes of the bad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On this days, during this festive Christmas procession, called &#8220;Krampus run&#8221;, many of the Krampuses are played by local men and women. They dress up in goat and/or sheep skin suits, strapped animal horns to their heads and they also wear hand carved masks. You can find this creatures while they’re dancing, whipping the legs of children, stealing hats and also handing out&nbsp; Krampus liqueur to the adults in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, Krampus&#8217; arrival coincides with an influx of refugees from Syria and Afghanistan; although the festival is much loved, it has given rise to concerns that newcomers may be afraid of tradition and its customs. Instead of canceling the parade, cities decided to educate newcomers, by telling them the story behind this tradition for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For so many years, Catholic people wanted to ban this tradition since Krampus is too similar to the devil. But this didn’t work and now this parade is one of the most loved in Europe, even in Italy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So everyone be careful, because Krampus is coming to town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month we interviewed Cameron Simmons, the English mother tongue that has been teaching in our school since the beginning of March as an English language assistant.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>



<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>I’m Cameron- I’m a student at the University of Kent and I study Spanish and Italian. I am in my third year- a year in which I spend abroad and is split between Spain and Italy. The first 6 months, I studied in Oviedo, Spain, and now I’m here in Darfo Boario Terme as an English language assistant until June. I am a big, big fan of football and a keen supporter of Arsenal! I love music and history, especially bands from the 90s like Oasis and The Artic Monkeys.</em></p>



<p><strong>A: Why have you decided to come to Italy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>As part of my degree, I chose to teach English abroad and Italy has always been a country that has fascinated me: I adore the food and I absolutely love the mountains- so Italy is truly perfect for me!</em></p>



<p><strong>A: Do you like our school?</strong></p>



<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>I think Olivelli is a great school! The students are amazing and have so many brilliant ideas! It’s slightly different to the schools in England but, nevertheless, the students are what defines a school, and the pupils here are fantastic!</em></p>



<p><strong>A: Is this your first experience in schools abroad?</strong></p>



<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>Yes, it is. It was definitely a daunting experience at first, but I enjoy teaching and I am passionate about the topics so it didn’t take long for me to adjust (maybe a bit too passionate as I tend to speak really fast and have to slow myself down!)</em></p>



<p><strong>A: What feedbacks do you have from students and what advice would you give?</strong></p>



<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>The students that have spoken to me have enjoyed the group work we do in class. They have, in particular, enjoyed the topics on propaganda and cancel culture. In terms of advice for students, I would add that it’s so important to engage and participate in class- make use of every second! Don’t be afraid to speak, even if you make mistakes.</em></p>



<p><em>As the classes are so short- if anyone has any feedback or comments, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:cjs88@kent.ac.uk">cjs88@kent.ac.uk</a>.</em></p>

<p>The new project “Aria Nuova in Valle Camonica” (New Air in Valle Camonica) was born with the consciousness that people are the major air quality allies, and the awareness that the main source of pollution is caused by domestic heating accessories such as pellet stoves and wood burning fireplaces.</p>



<p>This campaign has been commissioned by the Department of Ecology of the “Comunità Montana di Valle Camonica” with the support of AIEL (Associazione Italiana energie agriforestali) which promotes a correct and sustainable energetic valorization of the agro-forestry biomass.</p>



<p>To achieve this goal, it has been decided to release commercials on local TV channels introducing the subject insights. You can find more informations and advices on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmvallecamonica.bs.it/">https://www.cmvallecamonica.bs.it/</a>. This campaign is going to introduce the technological pontential of wood biomass combustion as heating of average dimention buildings, since according to the collected data by ARPA (Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell’ambiente), the air quality in the southern part of the Valley needs rapid interventions to be improved. The misuse of wood-burning heating equipment can cause an increase of PM10 and Co2 up to 10% more than when using them the correct way.</p>



<p>This article has been written in order to inform and raise awareness among those readers who will apply these advices, but most importantly among those who burn wood, since it is crucial to cut the emissions of those polluting factors.</p>

<p>For this month’s article we interviewed Michail Pantelis, who is a greek exchange student in class 3A SIA. He came in Italy a bit late, in the middle of November, due to COVID-19 restrictions and he will stay with us for still a couple of months.</p>



<p><strong>When did you decide you wanted to do this experience and why?</strong></p>



<p>M: So the truth is that I always wanted to do an exchange year: since I can remember I wanted to do it although I didn’t know when. At first, I was thinking of doing it when I would have been in college, but then, since I wasn’t happy and I had a lot of stress and problems, I decided to anticipate it.<br>So the reasons why I’m doing this exchange year are many:<br>1st to run away from my problems, 2nd to find myself, 3rd the routine tired me and so I desired to discover a new lifestyle.</p>



<p><strong>Did you choose Italy?</strong></p>



<p>M: In a certain way, yes. My parents told me that they would let me do this exchange year only in a European country. Italy happened to be the place, after USA, where I wanted to go and it’s also one of the places where I would like to live in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Which moments have been the best and which the worst until now?</strong></p>



<p>M: This is a hard question, but l am going to start with my worst time:<br>it was during Christmas and New Year’s because I always spent it with my family, so it was weird for me to be in Italy while the rest of my relatives were in Greece all together.<br>Anyway, the best times are a lot more: when I hang out with my friends, when I traveled with a camper, when I played with the snow and every time I spend some time with my host parents.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to those who would like to become an exchange student like you?</strong><br>M: Be open to new things even if they scare you.</p>



<p><strong>What would you have liked to know before coming here?</strong><br>M: That you have school on Saturdays.</p>



<p><strong>Did you already know Italian or did you study it at school?</strong><br>M: I always loved the Italian idiom, so the last two years I started some lessons so I knew the basics of the language when I came here.</p>



<p><strong>Were you afraid to leave during COVID?</strong><br>M: No, I wasn’t. I thought Italy was the best place because news made seem like everyone had Covid during the first lockdown.</p>



<p><strong>Are you enjoying your time here? Did you have expectations that you met?</strong><br>M: Did I expected anything else? Of course but despite things didn’t go as I expected them too, I&#8217;m still having a great time!</p>

<p>If you want to become an exchange student, you should read, as much as possible, information on the program that you want to follow. You also ought to satisfy all your doubts and answer all questions about the exchange year by asking the contacts that you can find in the programs or someone that has already tried this experience. To take part in the program of one year, semester or quarter, you have to pass a selection.<br>In general, you need to meet some requirements:<br>You need to be between 15-18 years old, there’s not a minimum level about the knowledge of the language of the host country (actually, you go there to learn that) but at least you have to have A2 level in order to have an interview (where they check your knowledge, your skills and see if you’re suitable to this experience). You can choose your host country, for example you can go to the USA, UK, Australia but also to francophone destinations like France or Reunion, German/Spanish/Portuguese-speaking countries etc&#8230; Afterwards, while you attend a high school abroad, you live with a host family, that has to have an interview, in which some operators verify if the family meets their requirements. In fact, the employees have to inspect their residence and to make sure that the conditions of the house meet the requirements to accommodate an extra person. If your parents are state employees or pensioners and you have good grades, you can apply for a scholarship to the INPS that can economically help you to sustain the costs of your stay. To sum up: once you’ve convinced your parents, you have to:<br>-contact an agency and choose the program that suits you the most<br>-pass the selection (it’s quite rare getting rejected by an agency)<br>-enroll to the program and complete the application (used for the bureaucracy and to find you a host family).<br>-wait for the placement and then it’s time to leave!</p>

<p>Every year, hundreds and hundreds of students leave their home&#8230;</p>



<p>Every year, hundreds and hundreds of students leave their home country in order to fly towards for a new life experience somewhere in the world. Starting from the last years, these kinds of programs are increasingly gaining public. There are also some scholarships available such as Itaca, Intercultura, a few offered by institutions and other companies. This experience can last a trimester, a semester but also a whole year and you can study abroad in a high school while living with a host family (or you can also go to a boarding school of your choice). You will have to do some exams once you’re back at your school, in Italy. Fortunately, MIUR (Italian ministry of education) recognizes the validity of this period of abroad studies so, due to law, you can&#8217;t be forced to repeat the school year you will miss in Italy. More specifically, our school, as written on the school&#8217;s regulation, encourages and welcomes international exchange programs but the students don’t think it promotes these projects enough, in fact there are just a few flyers at the Secretary, and the process of how to enroll to one of these programs is not really clear so we will try to clarify it for you… but in the next month&#8217;s article.<br>(though, if you want to leave for next year, we recommend you to start doing some research and contact an agency now, otherwise it could be late).</p>
