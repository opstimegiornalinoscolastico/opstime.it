<p>Irish folklore describes Leprechauns as men who wore red or green outfits and tri-cornered hats. These mischievous creatures can be tracked back to the 8<sup>th</sup>-century tales about water spirits which were known as <strong>‘luchorpán’</strong> which means ‘<em>small body</em>’. Even though some researchers think that the term Leprechaun actually comes from the Irish term ‘leath brogan’ which means shoemaker.<br>According to mythology, these little men find gold coins buried in the ground and store them all in a pot which is hidden at the end of a rainbow. But since they can’t actually spend it, some believe that this gold is used as a means of tricking humans and given the Leprechauns’ propensity for trickery, this is possible.<br>Leprechauns are extremely difficult to catch or trap, but if you happen to capture one of them, you can trade his freedom for his treasure and he will grant you three wishes provided you let him go.</p>



<p>According to a History of Irish Fairies by Carolyn White, there are no female leprechauns: there is no evidence of how they reproduce. The book says that leprechauns are actually deformed children of fairies. Although the legend is over a thousand years old, a Leprechaun was spotted in 1989 by a pub owner in Carlingford, County Louth. The man, O&#8217;Hare, claims to have heard screaming from a well and found the remains and clothing of a leprechaun. Each year the city organizes a Leprechaun hunt, although the aim of the game is to find plastic versions of the legendary creature.</p>



<p>Behind this myth there is a moral of the story. The fact that Leprechauns often deceive people who seek the &#8220;golden plate&#8221; can be a warning for people not to get rich quickly and not to interfere with other people&#8217;s things. However, the stories of the Leprechaun should not be taken seriously but told to amuse and delight us.</p>



<p>So, if you hear a tapping hammer and a wee voice singing, keep a sharp eye out, for there may be a leprechaun nearby!<br><br></p>
