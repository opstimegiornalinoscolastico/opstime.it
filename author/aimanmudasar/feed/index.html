<p>Throughout history, women have made significant contributions to science despite facing numerous obstacles and social biases. From Marie Curie to Rosalind Franklin, women have played a crucial role in scientific discoveries that have shaped the understanding of the world around us. However, it was not until the mid-19th century that women began to be formally recognized as contributors to scientific research. Before that time women were largely excluded from higher education and scientific research opportunities, and their contributions were often dismissed or attributed to male colleagues. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the earliest women to break these barriers was Mary Somerville, a Scottish mathematician and astronomer who became the first woman to be elected to the Royal astronomical Society in 1835. Her work on celestial mechanics and the discovery of a planet Neptune paved the way for future generations of women in science. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 19 and early 20th centuries, women made significant contributions to the field of physics. Marie Curie, a Polish physicist, and chemist discovered the elements radium and polonium and was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Her daughter, Irene Jolit-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize  in chemistry in 1935 for her work on artificial radioactivity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also important Italian women scientists who fought for gender equality by making important discoveries in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy. A well-know example is the neurologist and life senator, Rita Levi-Montalcini who represents the Italian scientist par excellence. Her greatest discovery: the identification of NGF, (Nerve Growth Factor) which influences the growth of cells of the peripheral nervous system and those of the brain and through which research is trying to solve diseases such as ALS or Alzheimer’s, led her to receive the Nobel prize for medicine in 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another well-known Italian scientist is the astrophysicist Margherita Hack. She was the first Italian woman to direct an astronomical observatory.&nbsp; Today her publications on the fascinating world of the stars remain immortal and remind us of her fundamental role as a science disseminator. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It is essential to realize that women have contributed to discoveries that are now extremely useful for us to obtain further solutions and new antidotes against diseases.  For this reason, I believe that the right to education should not be seen as a threat. It is time for developing countries to grant the same rights for girls and boys; because knowledge allows you to open new doors, to be able to dream the impossible and make it possible!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sarah Quereshi, a Pakistani aerospace engineer and the CEO of Aero Engine Craft, the first private aviation company in Pakistan that focuses on environment-friendly aircraft engines has made it. Sarah has designed the world’s first eco-friendly engine that is under development. She has been named one of the top 15 global aerospace professionals to follow on LinkedIn for her pioneering work on her breakthrough technology. She is ranked also among the top 10 most inspiring women in her country. She has received a total of 17 awards from both national and international organizations for her achievements in the aerospace industry. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sarah’s is just one of the stories that are slowly breaking down barriers and eliminate stereotypes about women, who were always judged inferior to men. Thanks to  revolutionary, clever and ambitious women who are now rebelling in many parts of the world groundbreaking change is on the way.  </p>

<p>How do you think we will live in the future? Who knows&#8230; Maybe teleportation will exist and distance will no longer be a problem; We will have no complaints about late delivery because there will be drones; in supermarkets everything will be automatic, there will be robots that help us in daily work; there will be no more highways because we will use flying cars orwe could evengo to Mars whenever we want as if it were a normal thing.</p>



<p>In any case, the future starts today and for once it looks bright; the birth of smart cities is only one example. Smart cities havean extremely specific purpose: to improve the quality of life of the people who live there, ensuring environmental, economic, and social sustainability.</p>



<p>The founding element is technology, in all its expressions, from the use of innovative tools to data analysis software environment too, butenvironmental sustainability is not only the efficiency of the transport system, but concerns every aspect of urban life: architectural solutions and buildings designed in an environmentally friendly way, extensive use of renewable energy sources and devices equipped with artificial intelligence. Technology, is essential for the careful management of resources and search for high-tech.</p>



<p>One of the most sustainable and innovative ideas is the invention of the so-called &#8220;HUNTING POLLUTION&#8221; these are massive works of art painted on the walls of buildings with anti-smog paint formulated by the Italian artist Federico Massa. He is the artist who used AIRLITE technology, an ecological paint that cleans the air. An example of this artistic work can be found in Italy:  the first eco-mural in the world was created in Rome and it is the greatest of Europe! It is a new green lung for the for the capital: 1000 square meters of amazing art able to clean the air like a forest of 30 trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="" alt="" /></figure>



<p>You might certainly feel you have woken up in the next century&nbsp; in one &nbsp;of the most famous smart cities in the world,&nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore:&nbsp; a Southeast Asian&nbsp; island and city state at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, with a population of 5.686 million people.Since 2019, the city has been considered the world’s smartest city because&nbsp; it works to “enhance the benefits and diminish the shortcomings of urbanization for its citizens.”</p>



<p>With 80% of its residents living in public housing, the country offers an extremely sleek system of public transportation called the Mass Rapid Transit. This is an underground system of transportation that reaches all over Singapore, and the concealed system of transportation creates an emphasis on public spaces. The urban organization of Singapore intends its residents to enjoy an ample number of public spaces, and urban forestry making the city very sustainable and green.</p>



<p>If you ever happen to take a trip to Singapore in addition to the fascinating historical monuments and natural parks do not miss the interactive museums that give you the feeling of being in a science fiction movie offering a lot of multimedia content. Another attraction is the &#8220;Supertree Grove&#8221;. The amazing thing is that these giants 25 to 50 meters high are incredibly non-polluting works of art! Indeed, their foliage is characterized by photovoltaic panels, and ventilation ducts capable of creating energy for lighting and giving extraordinary games of light and music during the night.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="301" height="226" src="https://opstimegiornalinoscolastico.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Immagine.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3350" /></figure>



<p>I must say that I am optimistic. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.In my opinion if  we all have the same goal, we can do everything to make our planet a better place for future generations too; investing capital adequately and using human intelligence not for destructive purposes, but for solutions that do not put at risk the only HOME we have. Well, with smart cities the future is already here!</p>

<p>Now, I dare you all to think how you would feel if you walked into a place where you do not know anyone and those few people you know behave like strangers to you. Of course, you would feel uncomfortable with all eyes on you. I think anyone would like to be welcomed when they are in a group. For example, when you first enter a new class, you feel oppressed by the looks of others and feel bad. I really think that nowadays at the base of this big problem there are always prejudices. </p>



<p>Today  people often give more importance to the way of dressing and physical appearance, neglecting the character of a person. If you do not dress fashionably or if simply your thinking is different from others you are seen as a strange person, especially among teenagers, diversity and  originality are seen as something ugly or even scary. </p>



<p>In my opinion this also depends on the influence of social media, on the different trends or fashions that <s>&nbsp;</s>&nbsp;they impose on society, encouraging young people to behave in&nbsp; a similar way.&nbsp; If the mass behaves all in the same way,&nbsp; the small percentage of people who do not want or cannot afford it, feel isolated and always under pressure.</p>



<p>It is time for fresh thinking, we should all be kind and sympathetic, we shouldn’t  be afraid of changes     but be ready for enrichment, because diversity is wealth and it is a gift! So, you must try to put yourself in other people&#8217;s shoes and make an effort to see what they really are. For example, if a person does not have the same style of dressing or way of speaking, why don’t start talking and find out how similar you are!   You might discover that you maybe have the same musical tastes, you both like  the same type of films, or you might be amazed to find out that the person you have in front of you   has lots of talents; that after all this shy and introvert person is funny and nice.</p>



<p>Sometimes it takes little to make someone day, with a smile, a hello or just asking how you are! I think you’ll agree with me that there is an urgent  need for inclusivity, that friendliness and kindness can bring down barriers among people; that everyone must do their small part to build a relationship, friendship or interaction. </p>



<p>“<em>Diversity and inclusion are about giving value to every human being, no matter our differences to make the world a better place</em>”</p>
